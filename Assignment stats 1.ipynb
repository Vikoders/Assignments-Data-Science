    "     Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.      It provides a more precise measure of dispersion by considering the distance of each value from the mean.\n",

    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "Ans - skewness of data tells how bent is a distribution density curve.\n",
    "      Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in a dataset's distribution. It indicates whether the data distribution is skewed to the left, meaning there is a longer tail on the left side of the distribution, or skewed to the right, meaning there is a longer tail on the right side of the distribution. A symmetric distribution has zero skewness.\n",

    "There are three main types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive skewness (right-skewed): In a right-skewed distribution, the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left side. This indicates that the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side of the distribution, with a few larger values extending the tail to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative skewness (left-skewed): In a left-skewed distribution, the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right side. This indicates that the majority of the data points are concentrated on the right side of the distribution, with a few smaller values extending the tail to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero skewness: A distribution with zero skewness is symmetric, meaning it is evenly distributed around its mean. In such distributions, the left and right tails are approximately equal in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is an important measure in statistics because it provides insights into the shape of the data distribution. It can affect the interpretation of descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. For example, in a right-skewed distribution, the mean is typically larger than the median, while in a left-skewed distribution, the mean is typically smaller than the median. Understanding the skewness of a dataset helps researchers and analysts make informed decisions about data analysis and modeling techniques.\n"

Therefore, the mean may not accurately represent the typical value of the dataset when outliers are present.\n",
    "Median: Outliers have minimal effect on the median because it is not sensitive to extreme values. The median represents the middle value when the data is arranged in order, so it is less affected by outliers at the extremes of the distribution.\n",

Since variance and standard deviation involve squaring the differences between each data point and the mean, outliers with large deviations can contribute disproportionately to the overall variability.\n",

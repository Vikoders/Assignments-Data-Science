    "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "Ans - Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Measures of central tendency provide a single value that represents the \"center\" or \"typical\" value of a dataset. The main measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing all values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It represents the balance point of the data and is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean and provides a robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset. It represents the value(s) that appear(s) with the highest frequency and is useful for identifying the most common characteristic(s) of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "Measures of variability quantify the spread or dispersion of data points around the central tendency. The main measures of variability are:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of data but is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies the average deviation of data points from the mean and provides a measure of overall variability. However, the variance is not in the same units as the original data, making it less interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance of data points from the mean and is in the same units as the original data. The standard deviation provides a more intuitive measure of variability compared to the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Interquartile Range (IQR): The interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of a dataset. It represents the middle 50% of the data and is less sensitive to extreme values compared to the range.\n",
    "These measures of central tendency and variability can be used together to provide a comprehensive summary of a dataset"
